  abstract: "In this paper, using a dataset containing individual bids on Portuguese debt auctions, I document changes in investors’ demand for sovereign debt during a debt crisis. I find that bid functions become more inelastic during the crisis. Particularly, the inverse of the price elasticity is, on average, up to thirteen times larger leading up to and during the crisis. That is, on average, in order to increase the amount raised by 1%, the price would need to decrease, in percentage terms, by thirteen times more than it had before the crisis. I then decompose the changes in demand into two components: a fundamental component, due to changes in valuation, and a strategic component, that arises from investors’ market power. Although the role of market power is negligible in normal times, it gets more pronounced leading up and during the crisis. The auction mechanism loses efficiency during that period as the government is not able to extract the full surplus from strategic investors. At their peak, inefficiency costs jump to 0.6% of the issued amount. Finally, I discuss a possible mitigation strategy. Everything else constant, shorter maturities should be used to avoid higher inefficiency."
