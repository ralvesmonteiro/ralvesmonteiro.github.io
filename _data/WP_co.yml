  abstract: "In this paper, we compare how different protocols for sovereign debt auctions affect borrowing, the cost of debt and welfare, when default risk is a concern. To do so, we build a theoretical model of sovereign borrowing and default with auctions and asymmetric information. We calibrate the model to the Portuguese economy under the discriminatory price protocol, prior to its bailout in 2011. Using the calibrated model we perform a counterfactual exercise by changing the auction protocol. We find that the uniform price protocol yields higher welfare than the discriminatory price protocol, and that these gains are highest during crises (up to 0.6% of permanent consumption). This result is consistent with the observed switch to a uniform price protocol (for long term debt). Our accounting for dynamic effects is crucial for this result. Given standard values for risk aversion of the borrowing country, the discriminatory price protocol performs better than the uniform under a single auction setting. Once we allow for repeated auctions, however, the uniform price protocol is preferred under the calibrated model. In fact, when default risk is a concern, the uniform price protocol provides better incentives for borrowing over time, as well as protecting investors from static dilution within an auction. Both lead to much better prices for the government, which more than justifies forgoing the insurance mechanism provided by the discriminatory protocol."

#  abstract: "In this paper, we study how different auction protocols make the government more or less vulnerable to multiplicity driven by self-fulfilling prophecies. First, we describe how using a discriminatory price protocol may create a new type of static multiplicity: as investors pay as bid, equilibrium bids depend on investors' beliefs about how much debt the government is going to issue in a given auction, and different beliefs may support different equilibria. Then, we show that this multiplicity hinges on the curvature of flow utility and that for linear flow utility the equilibrium under a discriminatory price protocol is still unique. Finally, we show that using the discriminatory price protocol eliminates the type of multiplicity found in \cite{c88}. With this we provide a rational for the use of discriminatory price auctions, particularly under low risk aversion, where the equilibrium is unique."
